                For this project, my fellow students and I reimagined an exhibition scene in Unreal Engine 5, exploring the theme Memories of the Past. Together, we blended nostalgia with digital techniques to create a space where personal and collective memories could take shape. Each section was carefully designed with a focus on atmosphere and storytelling, using light, composition, and interaction to evoke a sense of reflection and familiarity.

            <p>The ultimate goal of the project was to showcase the works in a virtual studio, where actors performed in front of an LED wall. A real camera, tracked by an array of infrared cameras, was carefully synchronized with the virtual camera in Unreal Engine 5. This setup created the illusion that the actors were interacting seamlessly with the digital environment, enhancing the immersion of the exhibition and blurring the lines between reality and virtuality.</p>

        <div class="tools-text">
            <p>A flexible OSC (Open Sound Control) system was implemented, allowing real-time adjustments to the particle system parameters during the shooting process. This setup enabled dynamic interaction with the scene, fostering creativity and flexibility. By manipulating the visual effects in real time while the actors performed, the system created a seamless integration between the physical performance and the digital elements, resulting in a rich, interactive visual experience.</p>
