                <h3>This VR project offers a cinematic journey through an infinite, dreamlike space that represents the mind and memory. In this vast, ever-changing void, glowing structures emerge, each holding shifting clouds of light and color. These floating forms act as vessels of memory, containing fragments of experiences that go beyond the personal echoes of moments and stories that belong to all of existence.
                    The light within these spaces moves and shifts, creating patterns that resemble cosmic nebulas. These glowing forms are ever-changing, reflecting the fluid nature of memory itself. As the light interacts with the space, hidden layers of recollection emerge, inviting viewers to experience how memories appear, fade, and transform. Here, memories are not personal or tied to any one story they exist beyond time, as part of a shared experience, much like the light that brings them to life.</h3>

                <p>I have chosen to use 3D models of cosmic structures like nebulas and supernovas because memories are often unclear and abstract.
                    Rather than replicating a personal experience, I want to use these nebula-like structures as a metaphor for memories. These cosmic
                    forms, with their shifting patterns and vibrant light, symbolize the intangible, fluid nature of recollections. The pure light within these
                    structures represents how memories can appear in bursts of clarity or remain undefined, just like how light and form behave in the
                    vastness of space. This approach allows me to explore memory in a more universal, symbolic way. I will also create procedural noise
                    patterns, which will be used to generate structures that look like cosmic formations. This noise will be applied to the models to
                    distort and alter them, adding a sense of unpredictability and transformation, much like how memories shift and evolve over time.</p>

                    For the PLAI 2025 exhibition, at Cinema Anteo in Milan, i curated this VR display setup as part of NABA's New Technologies sector dedicated to immersive experiences. The presentation features a VR headset mounted on an illuminated pedestal, combining an LED base panel with a synthetic glass diffuser to create a balanced, inviting showcase of the technology.
